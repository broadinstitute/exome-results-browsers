The Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) Sequencing Consortium is a global collaboration dedicated to aggregating, generating, and analyzing high-throughput sequencing data of inflammatory bowel disease patients to improve our understanding of disease architecture and advance gene discovery. The consortium was formed in 2014 with a commitment to data sharing, diversity, and inclusivity - we hope that the findings from this study and others like it will provide a foundation for further investigation of disease mechanisms and therapeutic discovery. This browser is part of that overall effort to display and share these results with the wider scientific community. Partnering with the Broad Institute, the IBD Sequencing Consortium has sequenced more than 50,000 patients as of 2024 from 50 research cohorts across the world.

The IBD phase 1 dataset (hg38) analyzes exomes from 28,718 Crohn’s disease cases, 17,991 Ulcerative Colitis cases, 3,417 Inflammatory Bowel disease cases, and over 97,000 control samples.

In earlier versions of these analyses ([e.g., 2022 paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36038634/)), the vast majority of samples were of European and Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry. At present, our sequencing efforts are particularly focused on increasing diversity study and focus on adding substantial numbers of individuals - particularly of African-American, Latin American, and Asian ancestry. Because sequence data was generated with various exome capture technologies over a span of ten years, we adapted and developed methods to reduce possible confounders and incorporated this information during the quality control and analysis steps. The first results have provided genome-wide significant results associating ultra-rare protein-coding variants in individual genes to risk of Crohn’s disease. Later releases are planned with a larger number of samples that will further increase power and will be released here before any publication.

We thank the tens of thousands of patients and families who generously contributed to our effort. This project is made possible by the generosity of many funders, including the Helmsley Charitable Foundation and the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), and the leadership of its members. We are incredibly grateful to all the [IIBDGC consortium members](https://www.ibdgenetics.org/) for their gracious contribution to make this collaboration possible. We welcome any feedback! You can contact us by [email](mailto:TODO:@broadinstitute.org) if you have any questions or suggestions.

The Belgium IBD ULG center includes IBD clinics from Erasme hospital, Brussels, Belgium (2800 IBD patients, 650 patients on biologics) within the Belgium IBD Consortium

**Control Collections**

The MIGEN Leicester and Ottawa Controls were ascertained from the control subjects being recruited as part of the UK Aneurysm Growth Study (UKAGS) and controls from the Ottawa Heart Study; a cross-sectional case-control study designed to identify genes that predispose to angiographically defined coronary artery disease. The ASC-NIMH Controls are from the ARRA Autism Sequencing Collaboration, created in 2010 to bring together an expert large-scale sequencing center and a collaborative network of research labs focused on the genetics of autism. These groups worked together to utilize dramatic new advances in DNA sequencing technology to reveal the genetic architecture of autism through a comprehensive examination of the exotic sequence of all genes. The Autism Sequencing Consortium (ASC) was founded by Joseph D. Buxbaum and colleagues as an international group of scientists who share autism spectrum disorder (ASD) samples and genetic data. The ASC-NIMH-Controls cohort was first supported by a cooperative agreement grant to four lead sites funded by the National Institute of Mental Health (U01MH100233, U01MH100209, U01MH100229, U01MH100239), and renewed NIMH grants (U01MH111661, U01MH111660, U01MH111658 and U01MH111662), with additional support from the National Human Genome Research Institute through the Broad Center for Common Disease Genomics (UM1HG008895, Mark Daly, PI). The UK-IRL-UCL Controls samples were extracted from EBV transformed peripheral blood lymphocytes from unscreened healthy British blood donors and from whole blood samples from healthy volunteers of UK or Irish ancestry. They were collected and sequenced with support from the Neuroscience Research Charitable Trust, the Central London NHS (National Health Service) Blood Transfusion Service, and the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) funded Mental Health Research Network. Sequencing was supported by the NHGRI Centers for Common Disease Genomics Genomics (CCDG) grant (UM1HG008895) and the Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research. The Epi25 Collaborative Controls are from a group of more than 200 partners from over 50 research cohorts from around the world formed to investigate the genetics of epilepsy. Whole exome sequencing data from the following Epi25 cohorts were included in these analyses: Germany: Bonn; Germany: Kiel; Germany: Tuebingen; Germany: Leipzig; Ireland: Dublin; USA: Philadelphia/CHOP; USA: EPGP; USA: Human Epilepsy Project; and USA: Penn/CHOP.
