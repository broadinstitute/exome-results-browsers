title: Terms of Use

All data here are released under a [Fort Lauderdale Agreement](https://www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/WellcomeReport0303.pdf) for the benefit of the wider biomedical community for use in the investigation of the genetic causes of schizophrenia and, more generally, medical genetics research. Data and results may not be used in attempts to identify individual study participants. You can freely browse the case-control results; however, we ask that you not publish global (exome-wide) analyses of these data or analyses of large gene sets until after an initial schizophrenia exome meta-analysis paper has been published (estimated to be in Spring 2020). We encourage broad use of the frequency reference data but note that case-control results are provided as general guides. Specific results may not have yet been subjected to the data quality, statistical, and population genetics review that would normally be required for publication or clinical inference.

If you are uncertain which category your analysis falls into, please [contact us](mailto:TODO:@broadinstitute.org)

We request that any use of data from the IBD browser cite the consortium's paper, [_Large-scale sequencing identifies multiple genes and rare variants associated with Crohn's disease susceptibility_](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36038634/), and that any online resources that include the dataset provide a link to this browser.
