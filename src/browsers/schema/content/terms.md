title: Terms of Use
---

All data here are released under a [Fort Lauderdale Agreement](https://www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/WellcomeReport0303.pdf) for the benefit of the wider biomedical community for use in the investigation of the genetic causes of schizophrenia and, more generally, medical genetics research. Data and results may not be used in attempts to identify individual study participants. You can freely browse the case-control results; however, we ask that you not publish global (exome-wide) analyses of these data, or analyses of large gene sets, until after the updated schizophrenia exome meta-analysis paper has been published (estimated to be in Winter 2026). We encourage broad use of the frequency reference data but note that case-control results are provided as general guides and specific results may not have yet been subjected to the data quality, statistical and population genetics review that would normally be required for publication or clinical inference.

If you are uncertain which category your analysis falls into, please [contact us](mailto:schema-inquiries@broadinstitute.org).

## Citations in publications

We request that any use of data from the SCHEMA 2.0 browser cite the consortium's paper: {TK: TODO - to be added}, and that any online resources that include the data set provide a link to this browser.

Use of data from the SCHEMA 1.0 downloads may cite the consortium's flagship paper: [_Exome sequencing identifies rare coding variants in 10 genes which confer substantial risk for schizophrenia_](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.18.20192815).
