The Schizophrenia Exome Sequencing Meta-analysis (SCHEMA) consortium is a large multi-site collaboration dedicated to aggregating, generating, and analyzing high-throughput sequencing data of schizophrenia patients to improve our understanding of disease architecture and advance gene discovery.

The Phase II data set (GRCh38/hg38) contains the analysis of exomes from 87,959 cases and 150,587 controls, and de novo mutations from 3,402 parent-proband trios. These results have pinpointed genome-wide significant results associating ultra-rare protein-coding variants in individual genes to risk of schizophrenia.
