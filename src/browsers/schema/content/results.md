Protein truncating variant (PTVs) or putatively loss-of-function variants: stop-gained, frameshift, and essential splice donor or acceptor variants. Aggregated counts from variants with minor allele count [MAC] â‰¤ 5.
MPC-prioritized missense variants: missense variants with a MPC score above the described threshold (see [Samocha _et al_. 2017](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/148353v1)). Aggregated counts from variants with minor allele count [MAC] â‰¤ 5 .
P meta: study-wide meta-analysis P-value
Q-value: P-value adjusted for the False Discovery Rate
De novo: determined to be _de novo_ of origin in 3,402 parent-proband trios
OR Class I: in-sample odds ratio of Class I variants, defined as PTVs and MPC > 3 missense variants
OR Class II: in-sample odds ratio of Class II variants, defined as MPC 2 - 3 missense variants
