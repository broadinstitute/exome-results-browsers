title: About GP2
---

The Global Parkinson’s Genetics Program ([GP2](https://gp2.org/)) is a resource program of the Aligning Science Across Parkinson's ([ASAP](https://parkinsonsroadmap.org/#)) initiative, which is managed by the Coalition for Aligning Science and implemented by the Michael J. Fox Foundation. GP2 serves as a central hub to generate genetic data from studies across the globe and harmonize corresponding clinical data. Our goal is to genetically characterize over 250,000 volunteers around the world to further understand the genetic architecture of Parkinson’s disease (PD). For data processing and QC pipelines, please visit our [Github respository](https://github.com/GP2code).

**Acknowledgements**

We would like to thank the many tens of thousands of participants who generously contributed to our effort. In addition, we want to sincerely thank all the GP2 members who are involved in the program.
