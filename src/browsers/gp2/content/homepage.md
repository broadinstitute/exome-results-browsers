The Global Parkinson’s Genetics Program ([GP2](https://gp2.org/)), a resource program for the Aligning Science Across Parkinson’s ([ASAP](https://parkinsonsroadmap.org/#)) initiative and implemented by the Michael J. Fox Foundation, is focused on improving the understanding of the genetic architecture of Parkinson’s disease (PD) and making this knowledge globally relevant and accessible.

This genome browser displays variant and gene-level dataset from individuals of diverse ancestries, sequenced as part of GP2 using the most recent GP2 Data Release 10 (GRCh38), for more information about GP2 Data Release 10 see this blog. Variant counts in cases, controls and other phenotypes can be found in the table at the foot of the page. Click on a variant to see the breakdown by ancestry and dataset included. By clicking through the dropdown and tabs, you can restrict the variants detected in the specific ancestry and dataset.

We would like to thank the many tens of thousands of participants who generously contributed to our effort. In addition, we want to sincerely thank all the GP2 members who are involved in the program. A complete list of GP2 members can be found [here](https://gp2.org/research-community/partners/) and [here](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7904831).
